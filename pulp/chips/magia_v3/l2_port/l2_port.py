    """AXI port of the testbench L2 (axi_sim_mem).

    Takes bursts from the beat plane of the NoC and accesses the memory behind
    it, which must answer inline. A read returns its first beat after the
    latency the memory annotates (at least one cycle), then one beat per cycle;
    a write burst is acknowledged the same latency after its last beat.

    ``req_latency`` cycles are added before the memory, and ``max_reads``
    (0: no limit) bounds the read bursts in flight, the next one being taken
    the cycle after the last beat of a previous one.
