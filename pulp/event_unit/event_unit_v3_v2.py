class Event_unit(st.Component):
    """io_v2 sibling of :class:`pulp.event_unit.event_unit_v3.Event_unit`.

    Same event / mutex / dispatch / barrier / soc-event behaviour; only the
    memory-mapped ports move to the v2 IO protocol
    (``pulp.event_unit.eu_v3_impl_v2``).

    The ports are IoV2SingleReq, not IoV2Sync: an event wait (or a mutex /
    dispatch sleep) parks the request and replies later from the wake-up event,
    i.e. the unit answers IO_REQ_GRANTED + a deferred ``resp()``. Every access
    is a single 32-bit word, so a single-beat response always covers it.

    No ``width`` is declared on the ports: the model rejects anything but a
    32-bit access with a warning, exactly like the v1 model, instead of having
    the framework insert a width adapter that would silently split wider
    accesses.

    Each core gets ``irq_req_<n>`` (identifier of the requested event, -1 for
    none) and ``irq_ack_<n>``, as for a core with a PULP interrupt interface,
    or ``irq_line_<n>``, the level of the request, for a core with RISC-V
    interrupt lines such as the CV32E40P, whose acknowledge then clears the
    requested event whatever identifier it carries. ``clock_<n>`` gates the
    core while it waits.
